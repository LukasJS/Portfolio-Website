        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, if you are reading this it must mean that you are curious about who I am (or you got really lost on the internet). Well regardless here is the overview of myself. My name is Lukas Suess born and raised in the East Bay and currently a student at California Polytechnic State University. I am studying Computer Engineering and I'm about to enter my fourth year. My major tends to focus on the physical aspect of modern technology with a fairly substantial chunk of software design, but my interests have strayed a bit. I'm most interested in front-end software and have a particular interest in design. My design style tends to be sleek yet cozy, that sounds odd but hopefully the design of this site can give you an example. 
        </p>

        As for my personality I have always been a very cut and dry kind of person but as of late I've been trying to tap into my creative side. I've found that web dev in particular alows me to combine creativiey with design and front-end development making it a perfect fit for me.
